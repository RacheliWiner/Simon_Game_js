    <p><h1>How to play the simon game?</h1><br>
        <br>
        Simon is an electronic memory game that, in addition to being fun, also improves visual memory.<br>
        At the beginning Simon lights up one of the buttons, and your job is to press that button (which lights up when you press it).<br>
        Next time the game will light up the button that lit up last time, and add another button that will light up after it.<br>
        <br>
        there are six colors:&nbsp;<br>
           red, blue, green,<br> yellow, orange and purple<br>
           <br>
        <!-- there are three symbols:&nbsp;
           glasses emoji, heart emoji, star emoji<br>
           <br>
        there is a number of symbols on the card:&nbsp;
           one, two, three<br>
           <br>
        there are three shadings: &nbsp;
           solid, open, striped<br>
           <br>
        Three cards form a set if each feature is either the same on each card, or is different on each card. For instance: all 3 cards are red, all 3 cards have a different symbol, all 3 cards have a different number of symbols, all 3 cards are striped.<br>
        <br>
        There are two degrees of difficulty: basic and advanced. The basic mode deals 9 cards, that contain exactly 4 sets; the advanced mode deals 12 cards that contain exactly 6 sets.<br>
        <br>
        For instance:<br>
        <br>
        DEALT 9 CARDS:<br>
        <br>
